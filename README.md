# UART
VLSI Implementation of a UART Module
This project implements a Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) module in VLSI, designed to facilitate reliable serial data communication between digital devices. The implementation uses the Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL) and is synthesised and simulated using Vivado. The project focuses on creating a robust, asynchronous, full-duplex communication interface suitable for a wide range of embedded systems and applications.
